      <b>Association football</b>, more commonly known as football or soccer,[a]
      is a team sport played between two teams of 11 players who primarily use
      their feet to propel a ball around a rectangular field called a pitch. The
      objective of the game is to score more goals than the opposite team by
      moving the ball beyond the goal line into a rectangular-framed goal
      defended by the opposing side. Traditionally, the game has been played
      over two 45 minute halves, for a total match time of 90 minutes. With an
      estimated 250 million players active in over 200 countries and
      territories, it is considered the world's most popular sport.

    <h2>Rules and Gameplay</h2>
    <p>
      The game of association football is played in accordance with the Laws of
      the Game, a set of rules that has been in effect since 1863 and maintained
      by the International Football Association Board (IFAB) since 1886. The
      game is played with a football that is 68–70 cm (27–28 in) in
      circumference. The two teams compete to get the ball into the other team's
      goal (between the posts and under the bar), thereby scoring a goal. When
      the ball is in play, the players mainly use their feet, but may use any
      other part of their body, except for their hands or arms, to control,
      strike, or pass the ball. Only the goalkeepers may use their hands and
      arms, and only then within the penalty area. The team that has scored more
      goals at the end of the game is the winner. Depending on the format of the
      competition, an equal number of goals scored may result in a draw being
      declared, or the game goes into extra time or a penalty shootout.[4]

    <h4>Name</h4>
    <p>
      Football is one of a family of football codes, which emerged from various
      ball games played worldwide since antiquity. Within the English-speaking
      world, association football is now usually called "football" in Great
      Britain and most of Ulster in the north of Ireland, whereas people usually
      call it "soccer" in regions and countries where other codes of football
      are prevalent, such as Australia,[8] Canada, South Africa, most of Ireland
      (excluding Ulster)[9] and the United States. A notable exception is New
      Zealand, where in the first two decades of the 21st century, under the
      influence of international television, "football" has been gaining
      prevalence, despite the dominance of other codes of football, namely rugby
      union and rugby league.[10] In Japan, the game is also primarily called
      sakkā (サッカー), derived from "soccer".

    <h4>History</h4>
    <p>
      Kicking ball games arose independently multiple times across multiple
      cultures. Phaininda and episkyros were Greek ball games.[15][16] An image
      of an episkyros player depicted in low relief on a stele of c. 375–400 BCE
      in the National Archaeological Museum of Athens[14] appears on the UEFA
      European Championship trophy.[17] Athenaeus, writing in 228 CE, mentions
      the Roman ball game harpastum. Phaininda, episkyros and harpastum were
      played involving hands and violence. They all appear to have resembled
      rugby football, wrestling and volleyball more than what is recognizable as
      modern football.[18][19][20][21][22][23] As with pre-codified mob
      football, the antecedent of all modern football codes, these three games
      involved more handling the ball than kicking it.[24][25] The Chinese
      competitive game cuju (蹴鞠, literally "kick ball"; also known as tsu chu)
      resembles modern association football.[26] Cuju players could use any part
      of the body apart from hands and the intent was to kick a ball through an
      opening into a net. During the Han dynasty (206 BCE – 220 CE), cuju games
      were standardised and rules were established.[18] Other games included
      kemari in Japan and chuk-guk in Korea.[27][28] In North America,
      pasuckuakohowog was a ball game played by the Algonquians; it was
      described as "almost identical to the kind of folk football being played
      in Europe at the same time, in which the ball was kicked through
      goals".[29] Association football in itself does not have a classical
      history.[17] Notwithstanding any similarities to other ball games played
      around the world, FIFA has recognised that no historical connection exists
      with any game played in antiquity outside Europe.[30] The modern rules of
      association football are based on the mid-19th century efforts to
      standardise the widely varying forms of football played in the public
      schools of England. The history of football in England dates back to at
      least the eighth century.[31]
